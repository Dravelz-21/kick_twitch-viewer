# twitch-viewer
Webpage with embedded Twitch player and chat

## Features

- Change channel & stream quality. (TODO)
- (Optional) Set a second channel to automatically switch stream to Kick if twitch stream goes offline. (TODO)
- 3rd party chat supports 7TV,BTTV,FFZ emotes.
## Why

Twitch's webpage is very heavy on most Android TV's and the official app doesn't have 3rd party emote support, this project aims to minimise cpu usage and make the chat experience better.

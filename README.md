# twitch-viewer
Webpage with embedded Twitch & Kick player and chat

## Features

- Channel change button above chat.
- Automatically switch stream if Kick stream either goes live or offline. (checks the same username that is entered in the prompt.)
- 3rd party chat supports 7TV,BTTV,FFZ emotes.
- Remember selected channel on page load


## Why

Kick's webpage is very heavy on Android TV's and theres no official app, this project aims to minimise cpu usage while making the chat experience better. 

Keep in mind this is a very barebones project and lots of spaghetti code but it gets the job done.

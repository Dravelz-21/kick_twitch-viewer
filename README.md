# twitch-viewer
Webpage with embedded Twitch player and chat

## Features

- Change channel & stream quality. (TODO)
- Automatically switch stream to Kick if twitch stream goes offline. (checks the same username that you enter in the prompt.)
- 3rd party chat supports 7TV,BTTV,FFZ emotes.
## Why

Twitch's webpage is very heavy on most Android TV's and the official app doesn't have 3rd party emote support, this project aims to minimise cpu usage and make the chat experience better.
